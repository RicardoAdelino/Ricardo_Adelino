Hi 

I'm a quantitative biologist working with data analysis and evidence synthesis applied to biodiversity, conservation, and climate change. 

My foundation lies in the Macroecology of Invasive Species 🛸 and Habitat Suitability Models 🖳

I'm interested in Machine Learning Algorithms 

...In the transition to more complex approaches for modeling non-ecological data
